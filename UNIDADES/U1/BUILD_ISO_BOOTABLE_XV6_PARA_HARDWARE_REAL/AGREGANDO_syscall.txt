To add a system call that can be called in xv6's shell, you should so something with the five files

    sysproc.c add the real implementation of your method here
    syscall.h define the position of the system call vector that connect to your implementation
    user.h define the function that can be called through the shell
    syscall.c external define the function that connect the shell and the kernel, use the position defined in syscall.h to add the function to the system call vector

    usys.S use the macro to define connect the call of user to the system call function

    defs.h add a forward declaration for your new system call (edited by itzhaki)

Which is a great reason not to ever use GNU assembler for anything.

While I think most people/projects use at&t syntax with gas, it actually seems to support intel syntax pretty well, see eg:

https://github.com/0xAX/asm/pull/2/files

I used to think it was "nasm or nothing" - but gas+intel seems rather pleasant too
